Description

Birdle is a 5-letter word guessing game. The game randomly selects a 5-letter word, and the player has 5 chances to guess it correctly. Each guess is evaluated, and the player is guided using color-coded hints.

How to Play

A 5-letter word is randomly selected by the game.

The player tries to guess this word by entering their guess in the input box.

After each guess, the game checks the letters and provides visual feedback using colors:

Interpretation of Colors

Red: The letter is not in the original word.

Blue: The letter is in the original word but in the wrong position.

Green: The letter is in the correct position in the word.

By interpreting these colors, the player can adjust their next guesses and get closer to discovering the original word.
